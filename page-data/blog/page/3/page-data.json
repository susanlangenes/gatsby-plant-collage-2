Basically, it comes down to flavor in oil production, but for our purposes, with salt brining, you can mix them all together regardless of what color they are at harvest and they will all be lovely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, pick your olives before the starlings get them and before they fall off the tree.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0214.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-999\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0214.jpg 720w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0214-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /><figcaption>Just harvested, November 28, 2018.

Note much more green! This doesn&#8217;t matter for salt brining.  </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2: Water Bath ~ 10 days</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately with salt brining, you&#8217;re immersing olives in salted water.  But before we do that, we need to soak them in plain water for several days to soften them and reduce their inherent bitterness.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wash your harvested olives well, and then put them in plain tap water in a suitable container.  You will need to change this water (and rinse them) daily for a few to several days.  Nichols Garden Nursery&#8217;s document linked above says that this should be a 10-day process; I can tell you from my own experience that sometimes, you need fewer days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you&#8217;re after is for the olives to achieve a softness and a slight darkening in color over the course of their water bath.  You&#8217;re leaching bitterness, basically.  Some factors might contribute to a lessening of the number of days: if the olives are wrinkled from summer/fall drought when you harvest them, they&#8217;ll need about half the number of days (so, like 5 instead of 10).  If they are harvested later in the season, I&#8217;d say that the weather and elements will help with the process of leaching, so if you harvest in late December, figure on a few days less.  If you harvest in January, or even February, or later still, cut back the number of days by 2-3 days per month.  If you harvest really late, like, April or May, you may not need to leach at all! You gotta play this part by ear a little bit. Or rather, by feel. You&#8217;re looking for a softening of the fruit and a color change from bright green to a dull &#8220;olive&#8221; green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what they should look like after soaking in water for 24 hours:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0258-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1001\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0258-scaled.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0258-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0258-768x576.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0258-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0258-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Olives get this foamy stuff on the top of the water after soaking for a day.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I do when I rinse them each day is I clean out the sink and set up a big colander:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0259-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1002\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0259-scaled.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0259-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0259-768x576.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0259-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0259-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then pour them into the colander:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0260-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1003\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0260-scaled.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0260-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0260-768x576.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0260-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0260-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then rinse with water, and pour them back into the container I&#8217;m using to soak them, and refill with fresh tap water.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0261-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1004\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0261-scaled.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0261-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0261-768x576.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0261-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0261-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 3: Soak in Salt Water &#8211; 4 weeks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When the olives have soaked in the plain water enough, it&#8217;s time to transition to salt water.

You&#8217;ll feel this too &#8211; they get a little more soft.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0262-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1005\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0262-scaled.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0262-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0262-768x576.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0262-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0262-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The salt water solution is 1 cup salt (I use either kosher salt or canning/pickling salt; shoot for non-iodized salt) to 1 gallon water.

This is how you know it&#8217;s time to get them into the brine.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ok now you&#8217;re going to change this salt water once weekly for 4 weeks.  Does that mean three changes? Or 4 changes? Again, I want you to feel this out.  I would say it&#8217;s 3 changes but you can do 4 if you want.  It won&#8217;t hurt them, and it probably won&#8217;t make them overly salty.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I do at this point is put a date on them, so I know when to change the salt water and when I should consider them done.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0266-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1009\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0266-scaled.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0266-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0266-768x576.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0266-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0266-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>The ones in the steel stockpot are still in plain water, but the ones in the plastic container have transitioned to salt already.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 4: Transfer to 1/2 strength brine and store</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the 4 weeks of full-strength salt water, now you will put them into a half-strength saltwater solution.  1/2 cup salt to 1 gallon water.  In this solution, you can store them on the shelf, or in the fridge if you prefer, I find it makes no difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flavor will improve over time and in a few months, you may notice a mild but delightful smoky flavor from your brined olives.  I have noticed this particularly with Arbequina but it has also happened over a longer period of time with Frantoio, which generally seems to have larger fruit.  So it might be a variety thing, but I think it&#8217;s more likely that the larger fruit size makes it take longer for that delectable smoky flavor to develop.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ok, that&#8217;s all for now!

Actually, I am going to do a little plug right now for one of my favorite local growers/nurseries, Xera Plants.  Several years ago, my friend and co-owner of Xera, Paul Bonine, wrote this great piece for Pacific Horticulture Society: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-pacific-horticulture-society\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"f7RtJ7495C\"><a href=\"https://www.pacifichorticulture.org/articles/arctostaphylos-for-pacific-northwest-gardens/\">Arctostaphylos for Pacific Northwest Gardens</a></blockquote><iframe title=\"&#8220;Arctostaphylos for Pacific Northwest Gardens&#8221; &#8212; Pacific Horticulture Society\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://www.pacifichorticulture.org/articles/arctostaphylos-for-pacific-northwest-gardens/embed/#?secret=f7RtJ7495C\" data-secret=\"f7RtJ7495C\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul starts his article with the phrase: &#8220;No other shrub is more symbolic of the Pacific Coast than manzanita.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, on his own website (disclaimer: I did the programming for that site but he did all the writing), he calls manzanita &#8220;the ultimate shrub of the west.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I cannot possibly agree more.  Why? Because in a xeric climate, AKA Mediterranean climate, AKA dry-summer climate, AKA totally perverse but also awesome climate in which plants have devised brilliant adaptations to the experience of receiving water from The Gods only when most of them don&#8217;t need it, there really is no better, no more pleasing, no more beautifully lush-year-round plant than the manzanita.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I fail to understand, however, is why they aren&#8217;t more common in gardens.  Actually we were talking about that the other day and all we could surmise is that there are a number of factors: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Relative novelty in the horticultural trade &#8211; they&#8217;re still not *that* easy to find and certainly not at places like Fred Meyer or The Box Stores</li><li>The perception that they&#8217;re hard to grow.  In some cases/species, this may be true</li><li>The need to plant them at a relatively small size (no, you can&#8217;t just go get a 5-gallon and have instant manzanita hedge).  A gardener must exhibit some degree of patience</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0190-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-983\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0190-scaled.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0190-300x169.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0190-768x432.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0190-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0190-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>An impressive row of 5 big manzanitas in Montavilla</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I counted, and I think I now have a total of 11 manzanitas.

I couldn&#8217;t be more pleased with this duo as a foundation to my front-door vignette. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s check on the first manzanita I planted here.   This is an A. x densiflora selection and I can&#8217;t remember if it&#8217;s &#8216;Sentinel&#8217;, &#8216;Harmony&#8217;, or &#8216;Howard McMinn&#8217; but I&#8217;m leaning toward &#8216;Howard McMinn&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0113-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-991\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0113.jpeg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0113-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0113-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0113-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Can you believe how amazing this looks in November?! </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I am really happy about that plant.  The small, narrow leaves work really well with the texture of the Gaura and lavender near it and I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing it eventually dominate this scene a bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of dominate, though, I actually planted another thing that will eventually dominate over the manzanita above, possibly to its detriment, but we&#8217;ll see &#8211; this is Arbutus arizonica, another gift from my friend Chris:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0114-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-992\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0114.jpeg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0114-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0114-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Arbutus arizonica baby</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This smallish tree has wonderfully blue leaves which are narrower than our native Pacific madrone, and my guess is that it&#8217;ll be a little more resistant to Phytophthora, although in this spot it should be just fine because it&#8217;ll never get summer water anyway.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0115-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-993\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0115.jpeg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0115-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0115-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0115-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Can you  EVEN with the new growth in fall?!

I like the lean they&#8217;re exhibiting, and they seem to benefit from the dogwood&#8217;s thirsty roots ensuring that there will be no soil moisture in the summer! Ha.  They&#8217;ve both experienced a bit of mold/fungus on their lowermost leaves, which I attribute to the presence of deciduous leaves at their bases and possibly to being a bit shaded, but mostly, I think it&#8217;s just that they&#8217;re young still and rather close to the ground.  They&#8217;ll grow out of this more or less, I hope. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ok that wraps up this week&#8217;s geekout on Arctostaphylos with a side of Arbutus.  Thanks for reading.

Now to find one&#8230; if anyone knows please dish it!  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over on the left in pic above, there are two plants worth mentioning.  One is a Gala apple that was not planted well (it&#8217;s very unstable and probably has terrible roots) and a Garrya elliptica.  You can see them both here &#8211; apple in back and Garrya is small, in front:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5919-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-956\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5919.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5919-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Apple and Garrya, which I&#8217;m realizing you actually can&#8217;t really see well in this pic.   </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What I intend to do is move that apple and probably espalier it somewhere else.  Backyard, I guess.  This is a terrible place for it and it needs to be re-planted anyway to get its root situation sorted out, if possible.   I&#8217;m hoping the Garrya will occupy its space, mostly.   I&#8217;m interested in seeing how this trio of shrubs (Garrya, Grevillea, and Arctostaphylos) ends up interacting with each other in this spot, which gets some pretty good blasting afternoon sun and heat, but is otherwise mostly dappled shade from the dogwood overhead.  And I think what I envision is for the Garrya and Arcto to get up-pruned, both quite a lot, depending on what they offer in terms of pruning opportunity.  Then the Grevillea can do its blob thing, but the whole area won&#8217;t end up being a totally solid evergreen wall; instead there will be some alternation and undulation of trunks and foliage.  I hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garrya elliptica gets pretty big, but seems to handle sun or shade or anything in between quite well.  I <a href=\"https://plant-collage.com/2017/10/australia-2017/\">saw one in Australia</a>, in the town of Leura in the Blue Mountains, that was in full shade and it was this lovely sinewy thing that wound its way up through other plants and a fence and was mostly up-pruned &#8211; I think that&#8217;s what I would hope to end up with.  We shall see. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not done, there are two more spots.  Let&#8217;s start with the less developed situation.  I am proud to announce that the oh-so-annoying English laurel hedge of encroachment is GONE.  Thanks, Dad! </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5922-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-958\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5922.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5922-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5922-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>10-15+ feet tall laurel hedge was here right at the edge of the ivy.  That&#8217;s the property line.  There will be no ivy on my property under any circumstances ever.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dad kindly showed up for two sessions with his electric chain saw.  First he cut the whole thing to knee-level, then after a few weeks and some rather impressive regrowth, he came back and chopped it again, this time flush with the soil.  There will be more killing in the future, and I want to discuss ivy removal with the neighbor (and possibly limbing up the dead branches of the blue spruce), but more immediately, we now have a LOT more gardenable space! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the view from the street:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5923-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-959\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5923.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5923-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>This was a solid mass of laurel from the curb to the Lonicera (dead center in this pic)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It is such a relief to have that gone.  There was also a cherry plum in there, about 25&#8242; tall, which we took out.  Nasty sticky drippy seedy tree.  Now there&#8217;s a pile of dirt and wood chips, both of which I really want to get out of there, and I didn&#8217;t take pictures focusing on them, but there are three large shrubs toward the street which will also come out: a Nandina, a Berberis (you can see it above on left), and a Mahonia aquifolium (my least favorite of all the Mahonias in the world).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m saving the best for last: HOT LIPS IS GONE.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5914-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-960\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5914.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5914-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>You can see its wake.. see how it pushed the Callistemon down and left? </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It went to a very appreciative home, along with the roses.  Those will both be GREAT plants for someone who loves easy-care flowers and border color.  That Salvia was something I&#8217;d put some effort into making peace with.  I appreciated its low water needs, its popularity with the hummingbirds, and its nearly evergreen-ness most years.  But it was really too much of something I didn&#8217;t truly love, especially in this most prominent spot in the entire garden, right by the front door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m now really happy with the plant selection here.  Let me give you an annotated pic:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5914annotated-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-961\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5914annotated.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5914annotated-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>and some Sedum oreganum and an asparagus fern.  That big culinary sage in upper left will come out eventually but that&#8217;s a whole nother post. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This plant palette makes me much happier than just the ONE BIGASS SALVIA which totally dominated this entire scene previously.  If &#8216;Ivanhoe&#8217; lives consistently through winters here, it&#8217;ll eventually have to move and what I might do is put it right where G. victoriae is, because this is too much hot afternoon sun for G. vic to hold onto its flower buds.  It has already aborted most of them, and we haven&#8217;t even had a hot summer.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But waaay down at the base of the plant, this one flower truss made it:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5924-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-962\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5924.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5924-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>I love this soft salmon pink color! Not what I expected, but I&#8217;ll take it.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But that won&#8217;t help the hummingbirds much &#8211; they won&#8217;t even know it&#8217;s there as it&#8217;s three inches off the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m finding that lately, my plant choices are shifting.  Rather than just whatever I think is botanically curious or super gorgeous, I&#8217;m taking into account a plant&#8217;s utility for pollinators, birds and other wildlife, and for local ecology generally.  Hyperlocal, even, inasmuch as that relates to my water provision regimes for the various hydrozones in the garden. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That does NOT mean, by any means, that I want to plant nothing but local natives.  I have a lot of those and I&#8217;m actively looking for more.  What it DOES mean is that I&#8217;m seeking maximum year-round support for hummingbirds.  I&#8217;m prioritizing native <em>and </em>non-native annual flowers that are super popular with the warm-season insect pollinators such as bees.  I&#8217;m starting to consider nesting materials beyond dog hair.  I&#8217;m interested in attracting beneficial and/or predatory insects (what eats flea beetles? I&#8217;d love to know). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically I&#8217;m seeing this garden more and more as not just my personal project, but a place that can favorably support a whole lot of organisms beyond just me.  That includes not just the wild and domesticated animals and insects that live here and visit, but also the people that live here and visit.  Tall order? Nah. Makes it all more interesting.  Big shoes to fill with all these large plants getting removed.  But it means we&#8217;ll end up with a better garden for everyone all around, in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for reading.  I&#8217;ll take better pictures next time I promise. </p>\n","link":"https://plant-collage.com/2019/08/big-shoes-to-fill/","featuredImage":null,"categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Arctostaphylos","slug":"arctostaphylos","id":"Y2F0ZWdvcnk6MTA="},{"name":"Front yard","slug":"front-yard","id":"Y2F0ZWdvcnk6MTE="}]},"tags":{"nodes":[{"slug":"agave","name":"Agave","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6MzQ="},{"slug":"arctostaphylos","name":"Arctostaphylos","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6NDc="},{"slug":"callistemon","name":"Callistemon","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6MTA4"},{"slug":"garrya","name":"Garrya","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6MTEy"},{"slug":"grevillea","name":"Grevillea","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6Mzc="},{"slug":"salvia","name":"Salvia","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6NjQ="}]},"author":{"name":"susan","slug":"susan"},"date":"2019-08-09T23:57:45","slug":"big-shoes-to-fill","excerpt":"<p>I called them my &#8220;freeway roses&#8221; and one time I had a conversation with my neighbor in which I told her I was thinking of removing them.

And native plants, grow all the natives!!!1!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Four years ago:</em> I&#8217;m not really sure I want to grow kiwis.  Tomatoes are not very pretty plants.  Oh well, have to grow em.  Watering is hard; maybe I&#8217;ll set up rainwater catchment.  Wow Rosa nutkana is 12&#8242; tall already.  Hm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Three years ago:</em> Jesus CHRIST this is a hell of a lot of work.  I do NOT want to have to build a kiwi arbor.  It&#8217;s hot out here.  I need to plant some shade trees and I do not need any more pears. Damn, rainwater catchment really does <em>not</em> work in a dry summer climate unless you have 18,0000,00000 gallons of water storage volume.  How little can I water the tomatoes? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Two years ago:</em>  Oh heyyyyy xeriscaping (bats eyelashes).  God it&#8217;s hot out here.  Ima plant me some more trees.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Last year:</em> I want nothing but manzanitas, weird Australian shrubbery, anything silvery, and everything also must have microscopic leaves.  Oh and if there are flowers in peach/orange/pink tones, bring it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Also last year: </em>I finally came to a realization that cannot stand all the rectangular garden beds (not really raised; more like edged with wood) that I&#8217;d built in years prior.  I hated the right angle turns I was constantly making.  I hated wrestling with the hose around corners and too-narrow paths.  And I started to not like the extremely variable overall form of the garden &#8211; tall plants over here one year, over there the next; vines here then there&#8230; I was craving more consistency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typical raised beds with wide paths all perfectly graveled, vegetables growing way up off the ground and nowhere near native soil is NOT the direction I wanted to go. I have GREAT soil &#8211; it is deficient in nothing and beautifully textured Latourell loam.  So ixnay on the idea of wider paths and taller beds; though that would certainly help with the hose struggle, I just don&#8217;t want to garden that way.  What I really want is curving paths and organic shapes for beds; foliar screens and room dividers; deliberate and artistic contrasts in texture and form.  Not ready to completely rip everything out and start from scratch, I set about removing all the 2&#215;6 cedar edges as beds which I had been growing vegetables became available over the course of the season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paths have started to form; I&#8217;ve lined some with bricks and others with old hoses, which I prefer, but old hoses are in limited quantity while bricks are abundant.  I started thinking even more in terms of water-use zones, and considered automatic irrigation in some key areas.  At this point I have given up at least half of the space that was formerly allocated to vegetable gardening and I&#8217;m preparing to lose even more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4629-e1558214100598-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"new garden path marked by hoses\" class=\"wp-image-900\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4629-e1558214100598.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4629-e1558214100598-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Look, hoses AND bricks here</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As one who sees herself as an avid vegetable grower, this is a big and somewhat challenging adjustment.  I never thought I&#8217;d be one of <em>those</em> gardeners who says, &#8220;yeah, I used to grow tomatoes&#8230;.&#8221; But here I am. Priorities change and I guess gardens change along with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, lest you think I&#8217;m done yet, I assure you I am not.  Under these lovely (ahem) covered wagons are a dozen tomatoes (most grafted), about 40 peppers and a whole bunch of melons of various types.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4630-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-901\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4630.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4630-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4630-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Irony. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s totally ironic that I&#8217;ve always disliked that white shed roof, and I&#8217;ve been pretty vocal in my complaints about it, but then I go and make all these ugly-ass hoop houses.  Do I really want to look at this?  The honest truth is that no, I don&#8217;t. But I still love growing the plants that are under them, and I&#8217;m not yet ready to say this is the last time I&#8217;ll do this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of, and in the midst of all that, as of April I have a new housemate. I want to incorporate her ideas about gardening and what she wants to grow, and perhaps satisfy her ideas about aesthetics as well, even when they differ from mine.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all potentially a lot of pretty quick change for me, and I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that I can take a long time to adjust to change, especially the type that feels like it reshapes my trajectory, I guess because clear trajectory feels hard for me to come by in the first place! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I DID manage a project along the lines of a trajectory that I&#8217;d already started playing with in the front yard: a dry garden area; in this case a bit of a berm.  This was where I grew tomatoes last year:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4499-e1558214906346-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"ducks help dig a new garden bed\" class=\"wp-image-902\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4499-e1558214906346.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4499-e1558214906346-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Debug team is helping.

These bags are about $5 each from Concentrates which is right down the road from me.  Easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4501-e1558214863832-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"plant placement in garden\" class=\"wp-image-903\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4501-e1558214863832.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4501-e1558214863832-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Almost all are treasures from plant swaps and friends</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t look very berm-y in the above photo, but the next one might give a better idea.

Lots of new growth on Bulbine frutescens (the green thing this side of the poppies). </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It really doesn&#8217;t look like much, but such is the nature of new plantings. I don&#8217;t love the look of the pumice but I&#8217;m willing to put up with it while I figure out a mulch; I&#8217;m not ready to commit to gravel so it&#8217;s probably wood chips or nothing.  I&#8217;ve added some bits of fencing and a big pot shard to protect little plants from the ravages of dogs and hoses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the ravages of dogs, do you have ANY idea how hard it is to establish new shrubs when you have two large-to-giant male dogs who get into pee wars? The damage is very real. After four or five outright deaths, I&#8217;m <em>finally </em>coming to grips with having to just fence around plants.  I&#8217;ve been reluctant in the past because if I fence off one plant, the focus will simply shift to another.  While that is true, it is also true that some plants can take more pee than others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I finally did this, in addition to multiple other fences around individual plants:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4631-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"garden fence to keep dogs out\" class=\"wp-image-906\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4631.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4631-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4631-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Fenced off are a young Eucryphia (among native blackcaps) and a couple of Carpenterias. Yes those are potatoes from 2 years ago at front right.  Shut up.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I know, it&#8217;s gross and it seems silly; why even let your dogs back there at all, you may wonder.  I&#8217;ll tell you: I want to have my cake and eat it too in getting these shrubs established, while allowing the dogs their backyard pee breaks since apparently it&#8217;s too hard to take them on walks out front so they can pee on the neighbors&#8217; shrubbery.   Besides, even if we made that a habit, these dudes would <em>still</em> have to mark, and mark on top, and on top, ad nauseam.  Even just marking, when the dogs are 70lbs and 100lbs, is significant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway. I&#8217;ll conclude with a list of what I put in that new bed, and a photo of my favorite of all of them.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Two Agaves maybe salmiana or havardiana</li><li>Three Sphaeralcea &#8216;Newleaze Coral&#8217;</li><li>Three Anaphalis margaritacea </li><li>Bulbine frutescens</li><li>Sinningia tubiflora</li><li>Hesperaloe parviflora</li><li>Eryngium &#8216;Neptune&#8217;s Gold&#8217;</li><li>Penstemon pinifolius</li><li>Dasylirion wheeleri from <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Cistus (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http://cistus.com\" target=\"_blank\">Cistus</a>, couldn&#8217;t resist it at Hortlandia</li><li>Callistemon pallidus &#8216;Eleanor&#8217; from <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"The Desert Northwest (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.desertnorthwest.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Desert Northwest</a> (also a Hortlandia purchase)</li><li>Aquilegia chrysantha var chaplinii from <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Xera Plants (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://xeraplants.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Xera Plants</a> &#8211; really cool blue-purple foliage, this one is from New Mexico/Texas.</li><li>Arctostaphylos pumila &#8216;Gray Form&#8217; also from Xera.  </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to my crazy fun gardening friends for the unsourced plants listed above, and to our stalwart local nurseries as well.

I am impressed.  After a bit of a rough start, this South African hardy Geranium (to low 20&#8217;s, according to Annie&#8217;s Annuals where I got it mail-order) has really taken off &#8211; it lost almost all of its leaves for a while because this is a rough area that is hard for me to water (hose isn&#8217;t long enough, soil is hard clay, blah blah blah). I planted it in April I think, and it took it a couple months to get established but now it looks great and I have high hopes.  I will mulch it well this winter and protect it with whatever I can if I have to.  Other sources say it&#8217;s hardier and I would love input on that if anyone has experience with it.  I&#8217;m a sucker for silver. And purple (flowers). And Geraniums in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Symphoricarpos (Snowberry)</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9640.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-850\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9640.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9640-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>this is not a great photo, but at least you can see the plant is green and lush</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My last winner is our locally native snowberry.  I got these at the Friends of Tryon Creek native plant sale in late winter of 2015 and decided to test them out here under the thirsty dogwood tree in almost full shade.  They are doing fantastic there.  I love these leaves, the plant form, and those snow-white berries in the fall/winter.  You can see them forming here if you look close. In the right setting I personally think snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus and/or other western species) can be a very good garden plant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are of course multiple others that I could show you, but with the selections presented I hope you get the idea that a bit of a shift is upcoming as I move toward a more sustainable and lower-input garden in the front yard.  I find myself much more excited about the plants that can thrive on their own with little or no input (read: water) from me, and there is a definite sense of accomplishment and delight with a garden that is aesthetically pleasing, botanically interesting, and also ecologically sound and sustainable.  It&#8217;s not all about laziness 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one last thing! I wrote this entire post using the new Gutenberg editor from WordPress &#8211; first time for me.  After a brief learning curve at the start (new icons, things in different places, etc) I have to say I LOVE it.  It feels faster and easier and smoother and just all-around better than the old WYSIWYG editor which I&#8217;ve been using for many years. Good job, Automattic.  There is room for improvement in small ways, but so far, I think it&#8217;s fantastic! </p>\n","link":"https://plant-collage.com/2018/08/midsummer-drought-test/","featuredImage":null,"categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Front yard","slug":"front-yard","id":"Y2F0ZWdvcnk6MTE="}]},"tags":{"nodes":[{"slug":"agastache","name":"Agastache","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6OTA="},{"slug":"agave","name":"Agave","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6MzQ="},{"slug":"arctostaphylos","name":"Arctostaphylos","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6NDc="},{"slug":"artichoke","name":"Artichoke","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6ODk="},{"slug":"cynara","name":"Cynara","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6ODg="},{"slug":"echinacea","name":"Echinacea","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6OTQ="},{"slug":"eupatorium","name":"Eupatorium","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6OTI="},{"slug":"gaura","name":"Gaura","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6OTg="},{"slug":"geranium","name":"Geranium","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6NDY="},{"slug":"imperata","name":"Imperata","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6OTU="}]},"author":{"name":"susan","slug":"susan"},"date":"2018-08-25T21:48:12","slug":"midsummer-drought-test","excerpt":"<p>Over time and increasingly, I&#8217;m finding myself wanting a completely xeric front yard.  It probably started with seeing posts by Danger Garden and Flutter &amp; Hum about Greg Shepherd&#8217;s garden, but there have been a million research projects, tests, conversations, garden visits, and boring hours watering plants by hand that have led me to commit [&hellip;]</p>\n"},{"uri":"a-visit-to-joy-creek","id":"cG9zdDo3ODg=","postId":788,"title":"A Visit to Joy Creek","content":"<p>Last Friday I made the trip out to Scappoose with my friend Carol to visit <a href=\"http://joycreek.com/index.htm\">Joy Creek Nursery</a> for the first time.&nbsp; They have a vast and wonderful display garden which held delights around every corner.&nbsp; We got lost in it for what must have been a couple of hours (it&#8217;s BIG).&nbsp; Here&#8217;s some plant porn for you:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_789\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-789\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-789\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8280-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8280.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8280-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8280-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-789\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hydrangea &#8216;Oregon Pride&#8217;</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Just as we entered the garden, Mike (one of the owners) came over and named a couple plants for us.&nbsp; First he showed us his &#8220;Plant of the Week&#8221; which he said he thinks might have to be &#8220;Plant of the Month&#8221;: Hydrangea &#8216;Oregon Pride&#8217;.&nbsp; I&#8217;m all for Plant of the Month (June) especially with that name because June was Pride Month, how apropos!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not big on Hydrangea macrophylla but I do love me some black stems!

It&#8217;s about my sanity, it&#8217;s about botanical experiments, and it&#8217;s very much about the immense joy that David and I get out of eating seasonally, preserving, and having our meals dictated at least in some part by what is available to eat in the garden on any given day.</p>\n<p>All that said, my own focus in gardening has definitely shifted from &#8220;food forest.&#8221; I still want to grow things we can eat, but not <em>only</em> edibles.  In 2015 we established two 4&#8242; x 10&#8242; vegetable gardening beds in the front yard, in areas that were previously lawn grass.  We edged them with 2&#215;6 cedar as we did with the 9 similar beds we have in the back.  Mind you these are not, for the most part, raised beds.  I&#8217;d call them &#8220;edged beds&#8221; because most of them aren&#8217;t raised at all &#8211; the cedar edging merely helps to keep grass and clover out.   It works.</p>\n<p>This year I decided to convert one of the beds in the front from an edged edible garden bed to an ornamental bed.  A lot went into that, and now I want to show the whole entire process.</p>\n<p>In August 2015, we began by making these two &#8220;edged&#8221; beds:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_725\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-725\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-725 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_0381-e1529859632203-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_0381-e1529859632203.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_0381-e1529859632203-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-725\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">After this picture was taken, we sunk the 2x6s down a bit</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The first year we planted brassicas and leeks.

You can&#8217;t see it well but there&#8217;s a Callistemon viridiflorus in there too, to help satisfy my craving for light yellow/chartreuse next to red.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m doing that with the big red Japanese maple too.  I may change my mind eventually and take it out, but for now, it&#8217;s really helping drive some design decisions.  In fact, that tree dominates the entire front yard and affects almost every decision I make, whether it&#8217;s about foliage color, plant form, or plant placement.  The venerable maple demands to be part of the conversation. For someone new to garden design such as myself, this isn&#8217;t just helpful but necessary.</p>\n<p>This has been a &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;during&#8221; post for this part of the garden, formerly vegetable bed #10, and now it&#8217;s basically two zones &#8211; the immediate surrounds of the Nothofagus, and the desert berm. Hopefully they&#8217;ll mush together a bit as the reseeders migrate around and I&#8217;ll end up with something interesting that relates to the rest of the front yard at least somewhat.  I should probably mulch the berm or add rocks? What would you do? Cram some more plants in there? All these plants are brand-new to me so I&#8217;m very interested in suggestions!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","link":"https://plant-collage.com/2018/06/the-evolution-of-a-garden-bed/","featuredImage":null,"categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Front yard","slug":"front-yard","id":"Y2F0ZWdvcnk6MTE="},{"name":"Ornamental plants","slug":"ornamental-plants","id":"Y2F0ZWdvcnk6MTk="},{"name":"Succulents","slug":"succulents","id":"Y2F0ZWdvcnk6MTc="}]},"tags":{"nodes":[{"slug":"agave","name":"Agave","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6MzQ="},{"slug":"cerinthe","name":"Cerinthe","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6ODM="},{"slug":"euphorbia","name":"Euphorbia","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6NjY="},{"slug":"grevillea","name":"Grevillea","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6Mzc="},{"slug":"hesperaloe","name":"Hesperaloe","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6ODI="},{"slug":"nothofagus","name":"Nothofagus","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6Nzg="},{"slug":"opuntia","name":"Opuntia","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6Nzc="},{"slug":"papaver","name":"Papaver","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6Nzk="},{"slug":"plantago","name":"Plantago","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6ODE="},{"slug":"stipa","name":"Stipa","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6ODA="}]},"author":{"name":"susan","slug":"susan"},"date":"2018-06-24T14:11:03","slug":"the-evolution-of-a-garden-bed","excerpt":"<p>Warning: long post.

Well, if you&#8217;re not familiar with it, let me tell you about this absolutely wonderful western native plant.  Bullet points for you speed-readers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Doesn&#8217;t get those damned fruit flies (<a href=\"http://spottedwing.org/\">spotted-wing drosophila</a>)</li>\n<li>Fruits start ripening in early June and continue well into July</li>\n<li>Fruits on old wood (floricane-fruiting)</li>\n<li>Thorns are recurved, so they grab you a bit, not horribly</li>\n<li>Gorgeous white bark, really cool looking in winter</li>\n<li>Spreads by tip-layering, not by runners</li>\n<li>Supremely climate-adapted and needs no supplemental water, ever</li>\n<li>Vigorous to the point of OMGWTF if you don&#8217;t watch it</li>\n<li>Fruit flavor is less tart. less bright, more complex, maybe sweeter? And they&#8217;re a bit seedier which I don&#8217;t mind.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So what I do, is I treat the thing just like a normal raspberry, except for the tip-layering bit (do not permit unless someone wants a plant).  And the watering (none).  When the floricanes are done, I&#8217;ll cut them out at ground level, and at the same time I&#8217;ll prune the primocanes back by about half &#8211; if I don&#8217;t do that they will eat things like my neighbor&#8217;s house, and pruning them encourages them to branch a lot, so then I get a more compact-shrubby plant instead of a 20&#8242; long bramble.  Like any raspberry you absolutely cannot leave this plant alone and expect it to behave.  But aside from that, in my book it scores well above normal raspberries (which, as previously mentioned, are all coming out this year).</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the whole plant &#8211; see the tall primocanes with the glorious white &#8220;skin&#8221;? On left, lower, are the floricanes which looked just like these primocanes last year at this time until I shortened them by about half. I&#8217;ll have to reduce the number of them this year, too.  Eventually this plant will get some form of support structure.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_716\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-716\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-716\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80511-e1529776317793-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80511-e1529776317793.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80511-e1529776317793-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-716\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Evidence of house-eating potential</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When/if these primocanes touch ground, they will root.  Right through grass and mulch and everything.  I&#8217;m helping this one so my friends Kate and Katie can have a plant.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_717\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-717\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-717\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80521-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80521.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80521-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80521-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-717\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">tip-layering, with assistance (totally unnecessary but speeds the process)</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_715\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-715\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-715\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80491-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80491.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80491-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80491-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-715\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Blackcaps are delicious</figcaption></figure>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-718\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80971-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80971.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80971-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80971-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember when I discovered these, as a kid, or who (Mom? probably, native Oregon kid that she is) turned me onto them.  But I do remember, every summer, going up into the woods and finding them at the edges of forests, and in clearings.  I had two particularly good patches and if I ended up encountering them unintentionally I&#8217;d have to use my shirt, or my hat, or whatever I could find (Acer macrophyllum leaf?) to hold them, because neither patch was particularly close to the house and, being a lazy-ass Taurus, I wasn&#8217;t about to actually go back and get some kind of bucket.  We made freezer jam with them whenever sis TJ and I would pick enough.  Rarely straight blackcap jam, though &#8211; the best was to mix them 50/50 with red raspberries from the garden. &#8211; that was everyone&#8217;s favorite.</p>\n<p>Freezer jam is the best because, since it&#8217;s uncooked, the flavor is much more true to the berry.  I asked Mom about her recipe and what she said is that she generally followed whatever was on the Sure-Jell pectin box.  Pectin and pectin-type products vary a bit in terms of what&#8217;s in them, and how they recommend going about it, so the things to remember are (god I love bullet points):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don&#8217;t use a sugar substitute, or try to use less sugar than the directions call for. This will invariably lead to disappointment.  If you want to preserve fruit but not with sugar, just freeze the fruit whole and you can make a simple compote in January with the frozen berries and little to no sugar.</li>\n<li>If the recipe says to strain some or all of the fruit to reduce the seeds, it&#8217;s optional, and you should experiment to see what you like.  I would definitely strain a straight blackcap jam, but I might not strain it at all (or just strain the blackcaps) if it&#8217;s half and half.</li>\n<li>Do not skimp or cut any corners with whatever the recipe says with regard to stirring and/or letting the fruit stand.  You want to make damn sure all the sugar gets dissolved completely and all the pectin does whatever it&#8217;s supposed to do.</li>\n<li>If the recipe calls for lemon juice, know that it&#8217;s not like adding lemon juice or citric acid to a low-acid fruit for shelf-stable canning.  In other words, lemon juice is mostly for flavor, and may help with the jelling process, but it&#8217;s not needed for preservation.</li>\n<li>Use whatever containers you want but again, since you&#8217;re just freezing, you don&#8217;t need actual canning jar lids and rings.  A good seal helps prevent freezer burn.  I like actual freezer jam jars with the colored plastic lids the best.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All right, now I feel weird because I&#8217;ve strayed dangerously close to the food-blog corner, so just to assure myself and you all that this is still really about plants, here&#8217;s another plant picture &#8211; The stems of R. leucodermis, as mentioned, look absolutely ghostly and really cool in winter.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-719\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_45081-e1529781512721-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_45081-e1529781512721.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_45081-e1529781512721-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","link":"https://plant-collage.com/2018/06/june-vegetable-garden-update-blackcaps/","featuredImage":null,"categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Back yard","slug":"back-yard","id":"Y2F0ZWdvcnk6MTQ="},{"name":"Edibles","slug":"edibles","id":"Y2F0ZWdvcnk6MTU="},{"name":"Native plants","slug":"native-plants","id":"Y2F0ZWdvcnk6NzA="}]},"tags":{"nodes":[{"slug":"broccoli","name":"Broccoli","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6NDM="},{"slug":"cabbage","name":"cabbage","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6NzM="},{"slug":"eggplants","name":"eggplants","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6NzQ="},{"slug":"leeks","name":"leeks","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6NzU="},{"slug":"lettuce","name":"lettuce","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6NzI="},{"slug":"melons","name":"melons","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6NzE="},{"slug":"peppers","name":"peppers","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6NTM="},{"slug":"rubus","name":"Rubus","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6NzY="},{"slug":"tomatoes","name":"tomatoes","id":"cG9zdF90YWc6Mzg="}]},"author":{"name":"susan","slug":"susan"},"date":"2018-06-23T12:48:53","slug":"june-vegetable-garden-update-blackcaps","excerpt":"<p>OMG where does the time go!?

No seriously, it&#8217;s worth considering using them in the landscape if they&#8217;re going to be like this.  They can get by without supplemental water in the summer if they&#8217;re mature enough, they do like rich soil but don&#8217;t absolutely require it, and if they flower, you can just eat that and let the plant keep going.  They&#8217;ll resprout from the stem if you cut them off at ground level.  And near as I can tell they&#8217;re absolutely perennial.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_155\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-155\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-155\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_26081-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_26081.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_26081-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_26081-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-155\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">15-month old cauliflower</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I guess it&#8217;s not ALL painful back here.  But wait, it does get worse&#8230;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_153\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-153\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-153 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_26041-e1509668821411-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_26041-e1509668821411.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_26041-e1509668821411-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-153\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Just ugggghhh</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The above picture is what it looks like when you walk out the back door onto the patio and look left, which is north.  There is just NOTHING good happening here.  The rain barrel is the most obvious eyesore and I really don&#8217;t know what I want to do with it.  Are these even useful at all in this climate? I&#8217;m doubting that.  I think at the very least, I&#8217;ll move it around to the north side of the house so it&#8217;s invisible.  We also haven&#8217;t yet finished painting the house &#8211; this is the original color.  The dark color you might have seen in other posts is the new color and we ran out of time before the rain came.  Ugh.</p>\n<p>The white trellis thing somehow ended up there &#8211; it was one of three of these that were attached to the patio roof support posts.  We had no love for them so they got removed and this one was probably being used as a dog-fence-garden-protector over there.  This is reminding me I need to deal with it in a better way.</p>\n<p>To the right of the rain barrel, toward the fence from the hydrangea, is Quercus hypoleucoides.  Ok, it&#8217;s the <em>one</em> good thing.  You can barely see it in the photo above, so here:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_158\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-158\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-158 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_26031-e1509672405710-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_26031-e1509672405710.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_26031-e1509672405710-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-158\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Quercus hypoleucoides, planted 9/2017</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As you can imagine, this is going to really change this scene eventually.  Q. hypoleucoides is an evergreen oak which will eventually get to 30 feet or so (reports vary considerably).  I planted this here because I absolutely LOVE it but also because I want it to obscure my view of my neighbor&#8217;s house (and his mine, why not?), to provide afternoon shade for the part of the garden to the east of the oak, and because I love the little willow-esque brown leaves it drops on the ground year-round, and the bright shade underneath that is due to the white undersides of the leaves. There are several 10-year-old specimens around a very interesting parking lot on NW Vaughn between 19th and 20th.  Another, about 20 years old, lives at approximately 915 N Shaver, and someone has a couple more in their amazing garden on NE 11th just north of Knott.  I looked at all of these (and looked on Google maps street view over the years) before selecting this tree.  I love all of these trees in all stages of growth that I&#8217;ve seen.  This plant was recommended initially to me by James Wilson of <a href=\"https://www.gardenstories.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Garden Stories.</a>  I bought it from <a href=\"http://www.xeraplants.com/Xeraplants.com/New_Homepage..html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xera Plants</a> this summer.</p>\n<p>The Hydrangea quercifolia came with the house, as did two large rhododendrons that used to be right on top of it; you can almost see where they were by the way this thing has grown &#8211; we removed them this summer because for a location so prominent, they were not the right plants.  Big, coarse, dark leaves, tons of lace bugs and aphids, messy after flowering, very short season of interest&#8230; it feels very bare without them, and I miss having plants here, but I don&#8217;t miss the rhodies themselves.  Of course, they were also hiding all these atrocities, like the AC unit and the cat shelves and the rain barrel.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the AC unit that&#8217;s actually the hands-down worst thing going on here.  It&#8217;s LOUD and I HATE IT but Certain People really can&#8217;t tolerate heat, so I have to live with it.</p>\n<p>The Plan, then:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Plant something dense and somewhat soft right where those hostas are, to shield the eye and ear from the AC unit.  I might also put something of a wooden fence on the near side of it.</li>\n<li>Prune the hydrangea to encourage more up-ish growth which will actually be possible now that the rhodies are gone.</li>\n<li>Move that rain barrel out of sight!</li>\n<li>Wait for the oak to grow.</li>\n<li>Plant some other stuff along that fence so I don&#8217;t have to look at it either.

She didn&#8217;t have room.  I did, it was female, and when it came time for harvest I asked another neighbor if he could help me figure out if it was ready or not (because he grew weed the year before), so he came over with his little weed magnifying glass and we looked at the trichomes with it.</p>\n<p>I have a plant-based story for pretty much every single neighbor.  Even my usual letter carrier! That&#8217;s actually a cool story too: I was digging a vegetable bed in the front yard and he asked, &#8220;Who are you burying?&#8221; After I replied with some suitably outlandish answer, we got to chatting and he asked if we used to live on 13th? Why yes, we did for about 10 years.  He said he was the letter carrier there too! And he changed to this Milwaukie route around the same time we moved here!</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not like I would never have met anyone if it wasn&#8217;t for plants.  I just think it&#8217;s very cool that I am connected to all these wonderful people through plants.  It happened back on 13th, too, because of course we did front-yard vegetable gardening there.  Strawberries and cherry tomatoes were gifts to the neighborhood and they loved them.  I miss having a sidewalk &#8211; sidewalks and parking strips make it easier to grow snackable food plants that people can reach.  But I can still send luffas.</p>\n<p>And now, part two, because I feel like it:</p>\n<h3>How to do up a luffa gourd!</h3>\n<p>Directions specific to the Portland area.</p>\n<p>First <a href=\"http://www.territorialseed.com/product/Seven_Happiness_Luffa_Seed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get seeds</a>.  Treat them like you would habaneros or watermelons; they need a long growing season and some real heat to produce well. Start indoors really early like February or March if you can.  Set out in May, or if you need to set them out earlier, give them some protection like a hoop house or something.  Passive solar heat exchangers, like jugs of water or bricks/rocks, are also useful I find.  As with all cucurbits, they will need ample water during the growing season.  And they&#8217;ll need something to climb on.</p>\n<p>These guys got sections of tennis net this year.  The bricks are passive solar heat exchangers for when I first set them out.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-140 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_08841-e1509579045607-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_08841-e1509579045607.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_08841-e1509579045607-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If all goes well, the hope is that the gourds themselves will have time to mature before the vines are killed by a good freeze.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_141\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-141\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-141 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_08851-e1509579178920-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_08851-e1509579178920.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_08851-e1509579178920-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-141\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">These *could* be harvested at this stage, but it&#8217;s better to wait until the skin darkens and gets hard and starts to crack.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>By the way the flowers are really quite pretty:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_139\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-139\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-139 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_07261-e1509579228578-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_07261-e1509579228578.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_07261-e1509579228578-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-139\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Luffa flowers</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I thought for damn sure I&#8217;d taken at least one picture of the process of skinning and cleaning a properly mature luffa earlier this year but I can&#8217;t for the life of me find it.  So, you get pics instead of how to do it with one that <em>isn&#8217;t </em>mature.  That&#8217;s actually better anyway!

This spot was begging me for something light-colored and upright in form.  I tried a Lomatia myricoides first, but it died quickly because I planted it into some imported soil that turned out to be really high in every nutrient &#8211; Lomatia, like all members of the family Proteaceae, can&#8217;t tolerate excessive phosphorus in the soil.  Hopefully the cypress will enjoy it (and, it&#8217;s next to that soil but not exactly in it).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve known for a while that Proteaceae members don&#8217;t like extra phosphorus, and presumed this is simply because Australian soils tend to be very low in it.  I came across a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262306045_Cluster_roots_of_south-western_Australian_and_Chilean_Proteaceae_a_curiosity_in_context\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">very interesting publication</a> that detailed what is actually going on.  Rather than try to distill it, I&#8217;ll quote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many Proteaceae, including Banksia and Hakea species, but not Embothrium coccineum , are readily killed by phosphorus fertilisation; they are highly sensitive to slightly enhanced soil phosphorus levels. They tend to accumulate phosphorus in their leaves, to concentrations that would be severely toxic to any plant (typically ≥ 1% of the dry mass). However, other plants rarely achieve such high concentrations in their leaves, even when heavily fertilised with phosphorus. That is because most plants reduce their phosphorus-uptake capacity when supplied with high phosphorus concentrations in the soil or nutrient solution. They close the doors through which phosphorus enters the roots when a big crowd of phosphorus molecules is waiting to move in. We discovered that the extreme sensitivity of H. prostrata and other Proteaceae is due to a very low capacity to reduce their phosphorus-uptake systems when elevated phosphorus levels are present in the soil. Some time, during the course of millions of years of evolution on severely phosphorus-impoverished soils, for many Proteaceae this trait disappeared.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Right right, millions of years.  Not gonna undo that, now are we? But wait, there&#8217;s more:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Having discovered the physiological cause of the phosphorus sensitivity of some Proteaceae, we made a wider survey of related species. Interestingly, some plants that are closely related to hakeas, e.g. , Grevillea crithmifolia , also belonging to the Proteaceae, do not suffer from phosphorus toxicity, even when exposed to phosphorus levels that are much higher than those that kill some Hakea or Banksia species. This grevillea closes its doors through which phosphorus moves in when supplied with a lot of phosphorus. We have also discovered that these traits apply to various species of South African Proteaceae. Relatively P-insensitive Proteaceae species are typically associated with soils that contain more plan-available phosphorus, e.g. , those derived from more nutrient-rich parent material. The sheer diversity of traits adopted by various Proteaceae from Australia, South America and South Africa offers enormous potential for breeders who are keen to develop new cultivars in the Proteaceae. It should not be too difficult to cross phosphorus insensitivity into new cultivars, which could then be grown without the risk of phosphorus poisoning in our gardens.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well how do you like that? So now all we need to do is find Proteaceae species that have this door-closing ability that are also <em>cold-tolerant</em>, and breed away.  Great! I&#8217;m on it! Just kidding.  Anyway I thought it was interesting, and it does give me some hope that someone someday will come up with a P-tolerant river lomatia.</p>\n<p>A couple of manzanitas:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_116\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-116\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-116 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25051-e1509143165569-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25051-e1509143165569.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25051-e1509143165569-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-116\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Arctostaphylos mewukka ‘Motley Crue’, from Cistus Nursery.

Anyway, this is an experiment with this C. annuum cultivar.  We shall see.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-110 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24981-e1509077052424-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24981-e1509077052424.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24981-e1509077052424-150x150.jpg 150w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24981-e1509077052424-300x300.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24981-e1509077052424-768x768.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24981-e1509077052424-440x440.jpg 440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lastly, for this post, here&#8217;s a little update on the Saintpaulia that was featured in my very first post on this blog.  It&#8217;s doing great!

And a scant few native Australian plants.  You would hardly have known you weren&#8217;t in the Pacific Northwest but for everyone driving on the left side of the road.  I guess I get it &#8211; I mean part of the reason I feel so compelled to plant Australian plants in my garden is to remind myself of the place, and people I love there.</p>\n<p>Side note: at the Royal Botanic Garden in Sydney  (to which I made three visits despite earlier proclamation of lack of interest in subtropical can&#8217;t-grow-em plants), there was a rather fascinating exhibit? planting? what do you call it? Section of the garden that included a lot of plants that Indigenous Australians used for various purposes such as food, medicine, material, shelter, etc., and some plantings that I can only describe as re-enactments of the first attempts at gardening by Europeans upon arrival.  I learned that they were so bereft of understanding and experience with Australian climate, weather, and soils, that they failed miserably in all aspects of food production and had to send ships to South Africa to bring food, at least until they started figuring it out.  Wow guys. But wait, what does this mean for PNW gardeners who like Australian plants? I&#8217;ll tell you.  The soil is basically 50% less fertile than our native volcanic mudflow loamy stuff.  FIFTY PERCENT LESS.  That&#8217;s what Proteaceae and Eucalyptus want.  Cheap dates, right? Nice work if you can get it&#8230;</p>\n<p>Anyway back to Leura.</p>\n<p>I picked up a book titled <em>Native Plants of the Blue Mountains, </em>which is a brief but fascinating handbook which covers about 220 plants and divides them into several habitat types, which were very apparent on our hikes.  We started with what is called &#8220;heath&#8221; &#8211; this is the habitat on the tops of the sandstone mesas, which has incredibly thin, almost nonexistent soil (it&#8217;s really just sandstone), and is dominated by Banksia and Hakea as the largest overstory.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_31\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-31\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-31 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_4007-e1508894942477-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_4007-e1508894942477.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_4007-e1508894942477-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-31\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Epacris pulchella, I think.

Well, the <em>after</em> isn’t all that great right now. But you love works in progress, right? I&#8217;ll definitely do some of this sort of thing.  An explanation of my experiences of gardening in my new to me house that I’ve lived in for three years? That&#8217;ll happen too, perhaps next post.</p>\n<p>Tonight I was in my office room, and I decided to do something about an ailing Saintpaulia.  Earlier today in Facebook land, we had some great conversations about drainage &#8211; I was worrying about Manzanitas, Australian plants, and various others I&#8217;ve collected this summer and now need to put in the ground. And then here’s this little plant. It&#8217;s just an Orange Box Special (I rarely buy plants there but one day several months ago this one followed me home. It has been flowering for me quite regularly and even now, and its current state of distress.</p>\n<p>But I want to explain to you why the Saintpaulia is important. As an introduction to me and my garden blog, I think it’s appropriate to explain that the very first plant that got me into gardening was of all things Saintpaulia.</p>\n<p>When I was a kid, somehow I got entranced with them. I tried so hard to grow them, but the house that we lived in had wood stove heat and very bad light. You can imagine how that combination of very dismal humidity, rapidly changing temperatures, and crap light made it very difficult to grow these things.  I&#8217;ve since almost never been without one.  I&#8217;ve killed many, propagated many, but I would never consider myself any kind of expert with them.  I just like &#8217;em, which is weird because I don&#8217;t really like anything else in that plant family.</p>\n<p>Anyway here she is, this evening.  In this pic I have removed the plant from the pot it was in.  I suspect poor drainage and maybe overwatering caused crown rot.  Look at these droopy leaves.  Major drought stress.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-14 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image1-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image1.jpeg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image1-768x576.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>I started to prick away at the root mass with my handy chopstick.
